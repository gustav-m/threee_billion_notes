# threee_biliion_notes - Generative Music written in Java

  * A small piece of program that plays totally differnt tune each time, based on the randomness of Java's Math.random() function and sets of tonal unit that I considered would sound beautiful in randomness.
  * This program only uses java's built-in sound library and some formula to generate sounds and has no dependency against any external libralies or external sound files.
